# PRODIGY_CS_03
HI,
HERE I AM DOING THE THIRD PROJECT OF CYBER SECURITY(CS) INTERNSHIP OF PRODIGY INFOTECH.
**PROJECT NAME-Password Complexity Checker
PROJECT DESCRIPTION-Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.**
PROJECT CORRELATION IN REAL LIFE - Secure Image Transfer: Encrypt sensitive images before transmitting them over insecure channels to prevent unauthorized access.
Digital Rights Management (DRM): Protect copyrighted images by applying encryption to prevent unauthorized usage or distribution.
Steganography: Hide encrypted images within other images or media to conceal their existence and prevent detection.
Secure Authentication: Use encrypted images as part of a multi-factor authentication process to enhance security for sensitive applications.
Privacy Protection: Encrypt personal or confidential images stored on devices or cloud platforms to maintain privacy and prevent data breaches.
By understanding and applying pixel manipulation techniques, developers can create secure and practical image encryption solutions for real-world scenarios.
DEFINITION - Pixel-level encryption and decryption of images, various pixel manipulation methods can be done for enhanced the security.
HISTORICAL ASPECT- Image encryption has a rich history spanning several decades, with key developments in both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Here are some notable milestones:
Early Cryptography (Pre-Computer Era)
Circa 600 BC: The ancient Spartans used a scytale device to send secret messages during battle. The scytale consisted of a leather strap wrapped around a wooden rod, with the letters on the strap becoming meaningful only when wrapped around a rod of the correct size.
Circa 1900 BC: Cryptography likely started in ancient Egypt, when a scribe used unexpected hieroglyphic characters instead of the usual ones in writing.
Modern Cryptography (Computer-Based Encryption)
In the early 1970s: IBM formed a 'crypto group' that designed a block cipher called the Data Encryption Standard (DES) to protect its customers' data. In 1973, the US adopted DES as a national standard. DES remained in use until it was cracked in 1997.
1976: Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a research paper on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which allowed for the dynamic creation of a pair of mathematically linked public and private keys for every correspondent, eliminating the need for a pre-arranged code key.
2000: The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) replaced DES. AES is a symmetric key algorithm that is royalty-free worldwide and approved for use in classified US government information.
2005: Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) emerged as an advanced public-key cryptography scheme that allows for shorter encryption keys compared to RSA and Diffie-Hellman.
