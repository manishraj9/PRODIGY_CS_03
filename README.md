# PRODIGY_CS_03
HI,
HERE I AM DOING THE THIRD PROJECT OF CYBER SECURITY(CS) INTERNSHIP OF PRODIGY INFOTECH.
**PROJECT NAME-Password Complexity Checker
PROJECT DESCRIPTION-Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.**
**PROJECT CORRELATION IN REAL LIFE -** 
1. Cybersecurity Awareness
Password complexity checkers help educate users about the importance of strong passwords. Many people still use weak passwords or repeat the same password across multiple sites. By assessing password strength, these tools encourage users to adopt better password practices, such as using unique and complex passwords for different accounts.
2. Corporate Security Policies
Organizations often implement password complexity requirements as part of their cybersecurity policies. Password checkers can be integrated into corporate systems to ensure employees create passwords that meet specific criteria, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. This is particularly relevant in sectors like finance and healthcare, where sensitive information is handled.
3. User Authentication Systems
Many online platforms utilize password strength checkers during user registration and password change processes. By providing immediate feedback on password strength, these systems help users create secure passwords that are less susceptible to brute-force attacks. This practice is crucial for protecting user accounts from cyber threats.
4. Password Management Tools
Password managers often include built-in password strength checkers. These tools not only generate strong passwords but also evaluate existing passwords for strength and security. They encourage users to replace weak passwords with stronger alternatives, thereby enhancing overall security posture.
5. Public Awareness Campaigns
Security organizations and experts frequently run campaigns to raise awareness about password security. Password complexity checkers can be part of these campaigns, helping individuals understand how to create secure passwords and the risks associated with weak passwords. This is vital in combating common poor password practices, such as using easily guessable passwords or failing to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
6. Data Breach Mitigation
With the prevalence of data breaches, password complexity checkers play a role in mitigating risks. By encouraging users to create more complex passwords, these tools help reduce the likelihood of accounts being compromised through techniques like dictionary attacks or brute-force methods. For instance, a strong password can significantly increase the time required for an attacker to crack it, providing users with better protection against unauthorized access.

**DEFINITION** - This script checks the password against the following criteria:
Length (at least 8 characters)
Presence of uppercase letters
Presence of lowercase letters
Presence of digits
Presence of special characters
**HISTORICAL ASPECT**- The historical development of password complexity checkers illustrates the growing recognition of the importance of strong passwords in cybersecurity. As digital threats continue to evolve, the emphasis on password complexity will remain critical in protecting sensitive information and ensuring secure online interactions. The evolution from basic password practices to sophisticated complexity requirements reflects the ongoing effort to enhance security in an increasingly digital world.
